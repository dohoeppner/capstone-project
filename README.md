## Vocabulary App - a short introduction

#### Learn anywhere and anytime you want and remember forever!

I am a very passionated language learner. Nevertheless: Building vocabulary is a very time-consuming part of this amazing hobby and - no need to mention - time is quite a rare good.
At school I was introduced to the very helpful and efficient way of enhancing my own vocabulary by using paper flashcards. So I spent hour by hour and a huge amount of flashcards writing down all the words I had to learn and then repeating them in intervals. As it worked quite perfectly I loved this method - but by moving more and more from one place to another spending more time somewhere else then in my home it got more and more inconvenient handling with a pile of paper cards... So I guess you've got already an idea where this is going... :)

Thanks to my mobile Vocabulary App, you can learn your very personal vocabulary whereever you are and whenever you have some spare time - when you wait in line, commute by public transport or spendnig some time on the Couch scrolling through your phone.
Enough written, let's get started: Memorize, remember forever and feel more confident in speaking any language you'd like to learn!

## Learn More - How to use the application

#### Home & Profile

After creating a basic profile you are able to add any language you'd like to learn by clicking the "Plus-Button" on the Home- or Profile-Page.
Just enter the name of the language to the form and also the fitting international language code (i.e. English - en).

#### Create

To add a new word to your vocabulary just switch to the Create-Page and enter the word/expression (Foreign language) and the correct translation and submit by clicking the "Create-Button".

#### Learn

For repeating, learning and memorizing the vocabulary just switch to the Learn-Page. A first flashcard will be shown by default. Try to remember the translation of this word/expression and control the outcome by clicking the "Toggle-Button" which leads to the translation.
In the same moment two other buttons will appear: The green "Check-Button" and the red "Failure-Button". If you remembered the word correctly, press Green, if not: no problem! Just click the Red button and try again later. :)
Like this a virtual pile of five randomly chosen cards will be shown one word after another. After these 5 cards you can decide whether you want to continue learning by pressing the "Continue-Button".
The number of repeatable cards is always shown in the navigation/menue next to the heart/learn-sign.
If you're running out of cards available for repetition the app will tell you - good job, it's time to rest!

#### Search

In the Search-Page you can - surprise! ;) - search for a word/expression. If this word/expression already exists in your private vocabulary library, it will be displayed. By clicking on the word you will get i.e. the opportunity to edit or delete it.
If the word is already archived (after several repetitions and answering with the Green button) you are also able to put it back in the repetition circle (i.e. if you really not remembering the word).
